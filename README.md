# CustomCobbleGen
This is a Spigot plugin that changes cobblestone generators in Minecraft
## 
With this simple plugin can you change all aspects of the cobblestone generator, as known from Skyblocks servers. Compared to the alternatives, it runs on a custom tier system, which means you need to buy, with either money or XP, the next level.â€‹
You can also have different tier classes, which can be used to give players with certain permissions more tiers. This can, for example, be a VIP class for players with a VIP rank. You can read more about this on the wiki.

### Features:
- Full customization (Everything from tiers to language files is customizable)
- Future compatible (No need to update at the release of the next Minecraft version)
- GUI to select and buy tiers
- Plug and play installation (Comes with pre-setup tiers)
- Active development
- Vault support
- Disable worlds
- Confirm buy GUI
- Placeholder API support
- Money, XP and Items, Level requirements for buying tiers
- uSkyBlock and BentoBox (bSkyBlock, AcidIsland + Addons) Support

### Future features:
- The ability to only have ranked tiers
- Purchase/select signs

I am open to new ideas/features. You can write to me over Spigot or on Github

### Requirements:
If you want to use money as a payment, then you need to have vault installed.
If you want to use the plugins placeholder in other plugins, then you need PlaceholderAPI
If you want to use Island Levels as a requirement, then you need to have either BentoBox or uSkyBlock installed
